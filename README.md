# No-Office
Office without the suite

I've personally become anoyed with almost all implementations of Office software for one reason or another, so it's probably about time to say good bye to Office software as we know it.

Goals:
* free as in both speach and <strike>beer</strike>coffee
* One person at business A creates a document and sends it to another person at business B
* Any document type: spreadsheet, text document, slide presentation, whatever
* to be continued

The concept:
* a self contained document
  * HTML shell (.html)
  * JavaScript controls
  * CSS styleing
  * JSON data structure
